Welcome! I'm **Narasimha Karthik Jwalapuram**, an AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University.

## About Me

I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to solve complex real-world problems. With over 2 years of industry experience at Boeing and current research work at Northwestern's CCL Lab, I specialize in Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing, and building scalable AI systems.

Currently, I'm working as a Research Assistant at the CCL Lab at Northwestern University, where I'm developing innovative frameworks for code generation using genetic programming with state-of-the-art LLMs like Grok, Claude, and DeepSeek models.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- **LLM Training & Fine-tuning**: Experience with GPT-2, Llama, and custom model architectures
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying RL techniques for optimization problems
- **Natural Language Processing**: Building RAG systems and document automation solutions
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understanding how AI models make decisions
- **Agentic AI**: Developing autonomous AI systems with LangChain and LangGraph

## Recent Highlights

- üèÜ **Finalist** for "Best Use of Generative AI" at TartanHacks 2025, Carnegie Mellon University
- üöÄ **Applied Science Intern** at Relativity (Summer 2025)
- üìä Secured **$200k funding** at Boeing through AI-driven document automation demonstration
- üéì Expected graduation: **December 2025** from Northwestern University

## Technical Expertise

**Languages & Core Skills**: Python, SQL, PyTorch, Transformers, Pandas, NumPy

**AI/ML Frameworks**: LangChain, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Elasticsearch, LlamaIndex, Sklearn, XGBoost

**Specialized Experience**: PEFT, RLHF techniques, Multi-GPU training (A100s), RAG systems, Vector databases
