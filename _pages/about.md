Welcome! I'm **Narasimha Karthik Jwalapuram**, an AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University.

I specialize in Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing, and building scalable AI systems. With experience at Relativity, Boeing, and current research work at Northwestern's CCL Lab, I focus on developing innovative AI solutions for real-world problems.

At **Relativity**, I led cross-functional AI initiatives to automate legal document review processes, building an insights extraction pipeline that processed 46,864+ legal documents with 87.5% accuracy and achieved a 60% reduction in review time. Currently at **CCL Lab**, I'm developing genetic programming frameworks with state-of-the-art LLMs including Grok, Claude, and DeepSeek models for automated code generation.

## Research Interests
- **LLM Training & Fine-tuning**: GPT-2, Llama, and custom architectures
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimization and decision-making systems  
- **Agentic AI**: LangChain and LangGraph frameworks

## Recent Work
- **Relativity**: Led cross-functional AI initiative reducing document review time by 60% through automated legal document processing
- **CCL Lab**: Developing genetic programming frameworks with LLMs (Grok, Claude, DeepSeek) for code generation and verification systems
- **Boeing**: Secured $200k funding for AI-driven automation and developed RAG systems reducing manual effort by 80%

**Technical Stack**: Python, PyTorch, LangChain, ChromaDB, FastAPI
