## üè• Advanced Medical Diagnosis with Causal Inference

Second OpinAIon is a sophisticated medical diagnosis system that leverages causal inference and large language models to provide comprehensive medical analysis, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations for healthcare professionals.

## Key Features

### üî¨ Causal Inference Engine
- **Causal Graph Analysis**: Identifies and visualizes causal relationships between medical factors
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Evaluates alternative scenarios to strengthen diagnostic confidence
- **Evidence-Based Diagnosis**: Ranks potential diagnoses based on causal analysis

### üíä Treatment Intelligence
- **Treatment Categorization**: Classifies treatments as causal, preventative, or symptomatic
- **Patient-Specific Planning**: Tailors treatment plans to individual patient needs
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed PDF reports for documentation

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis
- **Multi-Stage Workflow**: Systematic approach from factor extraction to final treatment plan
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic causal graphs and treatment comparisons
- **Natural Language Interface**: Chat-based interaction with the AI assistant

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Medical Factor Extraction
```python
# Identifies from patient cases:
- Symptoms and conditions
- Test results and vital signs
- Medical history factors
- Environmental influences
```

#### Causal Analysis Pipeline
- Establishes causal relationships (e.g., "Appendicitis ‚Üí Right Lower Quadrant Pain")
- Validates completeness of medical information
- Performs counterfactual analysis for alternative explanations
- Ranks diagnoses based on causal evidence

#### Treatment Planning System
- **Causal Treatment**: Addresses root causes
- **Preventative Care**: Prevents complications
- **Symptomatic Management**: Provides relief while treating causes
- **Personalized Adjustments**: Considers patient-specific factors

## Technology Stack

- **AI Framework**: Azure OpenAI API for LLM capabilities
- **Backend**: Python with Streamlit for web interface
- **Visualization**: Interactive causal graph generation
- **Documentation**: Automated PDF report generation
- **Analysis**: Causal inference algorithms and counterfactual reasoning

## Use Cases

### Clinical Decision Support
- Assists healthcare professionals in complex diagnoses
- Provides second opinions with causal explanations
- Identifies potential missed diagnoses through counterfactual analysis

### Medical Education
- Demonstrates causal reasoning in medical diagnosis
- Visualizes relationships between symptoms and conditions
- Provides comprehensive case analysis for learning

### Documentation & Compliance
- Generates detailed medical reports
- Maintains audit trail of diagnostic reasoning
- Supports evidence-based medicine practices

## Safety & Ethics

This system is designed as a **decision support tool** for healthcare professionals:
- Not intended to replace clinical judgment
- Requires medical expertise for interpretation
- Emphasizes transparency in causal reasoning
- Maintains patient privacy and data security
