## Advanced Options & Derivatives Prediction System

A sophisticated trading platform that combines statistical modeling with deep learning to predict options movements and execute intelligent trades in real-time.

## Project Overview

This ongoing project represents the convergence of quantitative finance and artificial intelligence, creating a system that analyzes market patterns, sentiment data, and historical trends to make informed trading decisions.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Market Data Pipeline
- **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Streaming market data from multiple exchanges
- **Historical Data Processing**: 5+ years of options chain data
- **Feature Engineering**: 100+ technical indicators and custom metrics

#### 2. Prediction Models
```python
# Hybrid Architecture
- Statistical Models: GARCH, Black-Scholes variations
- Neural Networks: LSTM for time series prediction
- Ensemble Methods: Combining predictions for robustness
```

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis Engine
- **News Scraping**: Real-time financial news analysis
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Reddit (WSB), Twitter sentiment
- **NLP Pipeline**: BERT-based sentiment classification

## Key Features

### Intelligent Risk Management
