Here's what you need to know:</p> <ul> <li><p>A policy (often denoted as π) is a function that determines what action to take given the current state.</p></li> <li><p>It defines the agent's behaviour at any given time.</p></li> <li><p>The ultimate goal in RL is to find the optimal policy (π*) that maximizes the expected return when the agent acts according to it.</p></li> </ul> <p>Imagine a robot learning to navigate a maze. The policy would be the rules the robot follows to decide which direction to move based on its current position and what it can "see" around it.</p> <h2>Two Approaches to Train the RL Agent</h2> <p>There are two main ways to train an RL agent:</p> <ol> <li><p>Directly: Policy-based methods</p></li> <li><p>Indirectly: Value-based methods</p></li> </ol> <p>Let's explore each of these approaches.</p> <h3>Policy-Based Methods</h3> <p>Policy-based methods directly teach the agent which action to take in a given state. They work by optimizing the policy function to maximize the expected rewards.</p> <p>There are two types of policies in policy-based methods:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Deterministic Policies</strong>: For a given state, these always return the same action. Therefore, <br><em><strong>action = policy(state)</strong></em><br>Example: If our maze-solving robot is at a T-junction, a deterministic policy might always choose to turn right.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stochastic Policies</strong>: These output a probability distribution over possible actions. Therefore, <br><em><strong>policy(actions | state) = probability distribution over the set of actions given the current state</strong></em><br>Example: At the same T-junction, a stochastic policy might assign a 70% chance to turn right and a 30% chance to turn left.</p></li> </ol> <h4>Example of a Policy-Based Method: REINFORCE Algorithm</h4> <p>The REINFORCE algorithm is a classic policy-based method. Here's how it might work for our maze-solving robot:</p> <ol> <li><p>The robot starts with a random policy.</p></li> <li><p>It attempts to solve the maze multiple times, keeping track of the actions it took and the rewards it received.</p></li> <li> <p>After each attempt, it adjusts its policy:</p> <ul> <li><p>Actions that led to solving the maze quickly are made more likely.</p></li> <li><p>Actions that lead to dead ends or longer paths are made less likely.</p></li> </ul> </li> <li><p>Over time, the robot learns a policy that consistently solves the maze efficiently.</p></li> </ol> <h3>Value-Based Methods</h3> <p>Value-based methods work indirectly by teaching the agent to estimate how good it is to be in a particular state, or how good it is to take a specific action in a given state.</p> <p>Key concepts in value-based methods:</p> <ul> <li><p>State Value (V): The expected total reward if the agent starts in a specific state and follows the current policy.</p></li> <li><p>Action Value (Q): The expected total reward if the agent takes a specific action in a given state and then follows the current policy.</p></li> </ul> <p>In value-based methods, the agent chooses actions that lead to states with higher values.</p> <h4>Example of a Value-Based Method: Q-Learning</h4> <p>Q-learning is a popular value-based method that learns the quality of actions in states, represented by Q-values. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</p> <ol> <li><p>Q-values represent the expected cumulative reward of taking a particular action in a given state and then following the optimal policy thereafter.</p></li> <li><p>The Q-function maps state-action pairs to these Q-values.</p></li> </ol> <p>For our maze-solving robot:</p> <ol> <li><p>The robot starts with no knowledge of the maze, so all Q-values are initialized to zero.</p></li> <li><p>As the robot explores the maze, it updates its estimates of the Q-values for each state-action pair.</p></li> <li><p>The robot chooses actions based on these Q-values, balancing between exploiting known good actions and exploring new ones.</p></li> <li><p>Over time, the Q-values converge, and the robot learns to choose actions that lead it efficiently through the maze.</p></li> </ol> <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2> <p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combines RL with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. In DRL, neural networks are used to approximate either the policy (in policy-based methods) or the value function (in value-based methods).</p> <p>For our maze-solving robot, imagine if instead of a simple grid-based maze, it had to navigate a complex 3D environment using camera inputs. This would create a high-dimensional state space that traditional RL methods struggle with. DRL can handle this by:</p> <ol> <li><p>Using convolutional neural networks to process visual input and extract relevant features.</p></li> <li><p>Employing deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function (in Deep Q-Networks) or the policy function (in policy gradient methods).</p></li> </ol> <p>A popular DRL algorithm is the Deep Q-Network (DQN), which extends Q-learning by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function, taking raw pixels as input and outputting Q-values for each possible action.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In this "Insights in a Jiffy," we've introduced the core concepts of reinforcement learning – policies and values – and how they form the foundation of how agents learn to make optimal choices. Both policy-based and value-based methods have their strengths, and the advent of deep reinforcement learning has further expanded their capabilities.</p> <p>However, we've only scratched the surface. Each of these approaches deserves a deeper dive to truly understand their intricacies and applications. Stay tuned for future issues where we'll dedicate entire articles to explore policy-based methods, value-based methods, and deep reinforcement learning in much greater detail.</p> <p>The journey into the world of autonomous decision-making is just beginning, and there's much more to discover in the exciting field of reinforcement learning.</p> <div><hr></div> <p>This article is part of our ongoing series on Reinforcement Learning and represents Issue #4 in the "Insights in a Jiffy" collection.
