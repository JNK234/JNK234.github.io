The main intention behind this challenge is to dedicate at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days to learning/coding concepts in deep learning.</p> <p>I will be sharing my progress via:</p> <ul> <li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/JNK234/100-days-of-deep-learning" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/JNK234/100-days-of-deep-learning</a> </li> <li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Narasimhakarth4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/Narasimhakarth4</a> </li> <li>Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/@jwalapuramnarasimha" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@jwalapuramnarasimha</a> </li> </ul> <h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3> <p>By doing this challenge, I want to explore and learn about deep learning and its applications. My primary motivation is the extreme optimism about how deep learning can revolutionize the future and how artificial intelligence can change the way humans live.</p> <p>My aim is to participate in various Kaggle competitions and implement research papers through this challenge. I hope that by the end of 100 days, I will have a rich portfolio of projects in major domains and I will try to base these projects as a solution for some real-life situations. I will try to document my learning as blog posts and share as many resources and materials that I will use in this journey.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e92b98c6b959" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
