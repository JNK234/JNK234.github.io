Our team was selected as a **finalist** for the "Best Use of Generative AI" award at TartanHacks 2025, Carnegie Mellon University's premier hackathon!

## Project: AdVocate - AI Marketing Platform

We built an end-to-end AI marketing platform that revolutionizes campaign creation, reducing the time from hours to minutes. The platform leverages Azure OpenAI, LangChain, and ChromaDB to generate multi-channel marketing campaigns with intelligent audience targeting.

### Key Achievements:
- **90% reduction** in campaign creation time
- **60% cost optimization** through intelligent caching
- Built a scalable microservices architecture
- Handled 50+ concurrent users with sub-second response times

### Technical Highlights:
- Implemented a multi-agent system for diverse content generation
- Developed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for brand consistency
- Created a two-tier caching system reducing API costs significantly
- Built with FastAPI, Redis, and PostgreSQL for production-ready deployment

Competing against top teams from universities across the country, this recognition validates our innovative approach to applying generative AI in solving real-world business problems.

Special thanks to my amazing teammates and the TartanHacks organizers for this incredible 24-hour journey!
