* At The Boeing Company in Bengaluru, I functioned in the Research and Operations wing of the Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) division, focusing on developing future-generation automated production systems for factory settings.
* Pioneered algorithms to enhance operations procedure automation by training ML models within the Boeing Network, which included creating a Keyword Extraction Model using BERT with 95% accuracy for extracting crucial keywords from operations logs and a text summarization model using a fine-tuned T5 model achieving a Bleu-score of 25.
* Developed an intent detector and extractor utilizing semantic rules with NLTK, achieving 95% accuracy in extracting action items and intents from operation logs. Additionally, I played a key role in the recruitment process, leading the hiring of six associate ML Engineers from a pool of 50 candidates.
* At Boeing Research and Technology in Bengaluru, I developed a Generative AI-based solution for automating updates to Aircraft Maintenance Manuals using feedback from design engineers' Service bulletin messages. This involved parsing thousands of AMM documents from PDFs into text for Large Language Model (LLM) training.
* I fine-tuned custom GPT2 (medium) and GPTNeo models, pre-trained on domain-specific aerospace data, with subsequent multi-stage instruction fine-tuning using a prompt dataset formatted in alpaca, achieving 80% accuracy in generated authoring. Utilized 4 A100 GPUs on High Performance Computers (HPC) for optimized LLM training using PEFT, and RLHF techniques.

*  I created cost models for predicting airplane part prices in the Tear Down Analytics lab using Python. This involved automating training and evaluation workflows on tabular data exceeding 2 million rows, reducing modelling time by 70%. Employed threading and multiprocessing for hyperparameter tuning using Optune, training RandomForest Regressor and Xgboost models on HPC to achieve an average r-score of 90%.

Q. What is one ML project/experience that you want to highlight?

One experience I had working at Boeing was in training and developing a Generative AI solution for a technical publications team. As part of the problem statement, we had to create an automated bot or algorithm to generate new technical documents by ingesting old documents and relevant change drivers.

I had to parse over 2000 PDF documents containing technical content, tables, and diagrams. Initially, I tried using standard PDF parsers, but they weren’t working well. So, I created a custom parser that converts PDF documents to Markdown files and then extracts the necessary information using NLP techniques.

After collecting and structuring the dataset in the instruction-finetuning format, I approached the problem by first performing full fine-tuning of LLMs (I tried GPT-2 and Mistral-7B, among others). Then, I fine-tuned LORA and relevant tokenizers to adapt to the domain vocabulary. Finally, I created an end-to-end pipeline for automated training and validation.

After some testing, I implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to improve the efficiency of text generation. I stored and retrieved context from ChromaDB and Langchain to support the RAG system and handle new data without the need for re-training. As a result, I was able to deliver a working prototype that generated new technical documents for different customer needs and use cases. This led to a significant reduction in manual effort, with an 80% decrease.
